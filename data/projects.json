The job fetches GPU prices from popular retailer online stores and saves them to a MySQL database. The database is controlled using Prisma ORM. The script also makes use of libraries such as node-html-parser and axios to retrieve and parse the scraped data. It also incorporates error handling mechanisms, logging, and monitoring to ensure that everything runs seamlessly and without disruptions. It was designed to retrieve the latest prices on a daily basis, making it useful for monitoring and analyzing price trends, and making informed purchasing decisions.",
